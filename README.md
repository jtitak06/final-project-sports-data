**My Process**

This project is a sports data API with the four major American team sports' leagues. The first step to build this project was to create the HTML and CSS. I wanted to create a video background which was something I had not previously done before. I felt that this project was the perfect opportunity to do that because I wanted to add a little bit of flair and style to this project. To create the video for the video background, I first downloaded video clips from a free stock footage website. Once I downloaded the videos, I edited than with a video editor to make it appropriate for use. While researching how to create a video background, the video that I watched stated that videos on mobile can eat up the viewer's data. Therefore, I did not make the video available on mobile. Instead, replacing it with a sports image from a free stock photo website.

After the HTML and CSS styling was complete, it was time to retrieve the sports data. Upon researching for the data I was looking for, I was unable to find any appropriate APIs. This led me to creatibng the APIs myself. This was my first time creating an API and great practice as this was something I wanted to utilize. I found a YouTube video on how to upload APIs to Heroku. This was extremely helpful and provided the necessary solution.

After the APIs were created and hosted on Heroku, it was time to fetch the APIs. After the APIs were fetched, I wanted to display them on their respective sports data page once clicked. For this, I had the professor at TrueCoders assist me with this. Once the API was fetched, he showed me how we can use innerHTML to display the results from the fetched API. All of this code was written in separate JS files for each respective sports league page.
